### Reflection
Being absent made it harder to contribute towards the project, making us swamped with a lot of work, so working in a team under deadline pressure taught me the importance of communication, organisation, and proper use of  GitHub and Markdown.

### Reflection
I found this challenging mostly because of time management with other classes, rather than the code itself. I have gained a deeper understanding of Binary Search Trees and how to implement search, deletion, and balancing efficiently. I also improved my GitHub skills, and overall, I contributed to both coding and documentation, working with my team to complete the project.

### Reflection

We had a lot of struggles making this work, not because the code was difficult or we did not understand it, but because we were away and then swamped with finishing work and projects for other classes. Apart from that, I learned more in-depth about the inner workings of Binary Search Trees and where to use them, as well as how to work with GitHub Markdown files and how to put stuff more understandably. I did all of the initial set-up and was the main driving force for our team to get over the finish line, even with all of the problems we faced.
