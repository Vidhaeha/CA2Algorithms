## Reflection

We had a lot of struggles making this work not because the code was difficult or we did not understand it but because we were away and then swamped with finishing work and projects for other classes. Apart from that I learned more in depth about the inner workings of Binary Search Trees and where to use them as well as how to work with GitHub MarkDown files and how to put stuff in a more understandable way. I did all of the initial set-up and was the main driving force for our team to get over the finish line even with all of the problems we faced.
