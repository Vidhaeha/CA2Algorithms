😋 Overview
In this section, we will explore what a Binary Search Tree (BST) is, why it is used, and when it becomes the right choice in problem-solving. We will outline the problem it addresses, its common applications, and the reasoning behind choosing this particular data structure over others.

## What is a Binary Search Tree?

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a form of a binary tree designed to store data in a way that allows fast searching, insertion, and deletion. Unlike a regular binary tree, a BST uses ordering rules:
The left child subtree of any node has values less than the node’s value.
The right child subtree has values greater than the node’s value.
