## 😋 Overview
In this section, we will explore what a Binary Search Tree (BST) is, why it is used, and when it becomes the right choice in problem-solving. We will outline the problem it addresses, its common applications, and the reasoning behind choosing this particular data structure over others.

## What is a Binary Search Tree?

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a form of a binary tree designed to store data in a way that allows fast searching, insertion, and deletion. Unlike a regular binary tree, a BST uses ordering rules:
The left child subtree of any node has values less than the node’s value.
The right child subtree has values greater than the node’s value.

## Why Use a Binary Search Tree? 😵‍💫

A Binary Search Tree is useful when you have a lot of data that needs to stay sorted and you want to find things quickly.

Instead of checking every item one by one, a BST narrows the search path step-by-step. This makes searching, adding, and removing data much faster.

Examples:

Search engines use BST-like structures to scan huge datasets and speed up search results.

Game engines, like the original Doom, used tree structures to decide what objects to draw and where they should appear on screen.
