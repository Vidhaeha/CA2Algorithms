😋 Overview
In this section, we will explore what a Binary Search Tree (BST) is, why it is used, and when it becomes the right choice in problem-solving. We will outline the problem it addresses, its common applications, and the reasoning behind choosing this particular data structure over others.

## What is a Binary Search Tree?

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialized form of a binary tree designed to store data in a way that allows fast searching, insertion, and deletion. Unlike a regular binary tree, a BST enforces ordering rules:

The left child subtree of any node contains values less than the node’s value.

The right child subtree contains values greater than the node’s value.

This structural property enables efficient lookup—similar in spirit to binary search on a sorted array—but applied to hierarchical data rather than sequential storage.
